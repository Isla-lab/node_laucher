# ISLa Lab mini-cluster ðŸš€

This is the repo containing the instructions and code to access and run your processes on the ISLa mini-cluster. Please read the instructions below carefully before proceeding. If you have any questions or errors contact alessandro.farinelli@univr.it.

## How use the mini-cluster

Our mini-cluster is based on a *publisher-subscriber* architecture. Specifically, we report the steps to obtain login credentials and the procedures to be performed to launch the scripts on our machines.

1) Get the credentials: contact alberto.castellini@univr.it to obtain credentials to one of the cluster nodes. In the email, specify whether you intend to use GPU or CPU only. The administrator given the availability of nodes will provide you with a username and password.
